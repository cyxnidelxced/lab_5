    <h1>Lab 5: Responsive Images</h1>

    <!-- 1. Responsive Background Image -->
    <div id="bg-image" class="example-section">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-image"></i> 1. Responsive Background Image</h2>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates a responsive background image using CSS properties. The image's position and size change based on the viewport width:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>On large screens (>768px): The image is centered and uses "cover" to fill the container</li>
            <li>On medium screens (768px and below): The image is positioned at the top center</li>
            <li>On small screens (480px and below): The image uses "contain" for the size and is centered at the top</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The CSS properties used are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>background-image</li>
            <li>background-position</li>
            <li>background-size</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Try resizing your browser to see how the image adapts to different viewport sizes.</p>
        <div class="bg-image-container"></div>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Object-fit Example -->
    <div id="object-fit" class="example-section">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-crop-alt"></i> 2. Object-fit and Object-position Properties</h2>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates how "object-fit: cover" combined with "object-position" creates responsive images that scale without distortion. The image maintains its aspect ratio while filling the container completely, and the visible portion changes based on screen size:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>On large screens: Image is centered (object-position: center)</li>
            <li>On medium screens (≤768px): Image shows the top portion (object-position: top)</li>
            <li>On small screens (≤480px): Image shows the left portion (object-position: left)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This approach prevents stretching or distortion while ensuring the most important parts of the image remain visible at different screen sizes. Try resizing your browser to see the effect.</p>
